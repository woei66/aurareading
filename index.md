# 為何你需要做氣場解讀?

我替許多人做過氣場解讀。有人覺得非常準、對他們幫助很大；也有人感受不深，或只覺得似乎有些幫助。

多數人看待氣場解讀的方式，往往與看醫生相同：
如果身體有感冒、流感或糖尿病，就期望看醫生、吃藥後，症狀能立刻改善。因此他們也會期待氣場解讀能快速解決問題，最好能在一兩週內見效。

但如果你從事能量療癒，你會知道氣場（或稱人體能量場）的運作方式。你明白療癒師做的是協助調整對方的能量場，讓脈輪恢復流動、解除阻塞。一旦脈輪順暢，只要個案願意保持積極正向的意願，就有機會自我修復。

能量療癒是一種 **長期、以自我療癒為核心** 的方式。會主動尋求療癒的人，通常具有較高的自我覺察，心態也較為開放，願意接觸新的觀念。

## 有人問我：氣場解讀到底能提供什麼幫助？

我們都知道生活環境會影響健康：
住在發電廠或飛機航道旁對身體不好；
住在公園附近、家裡通風採光良好會讓人感覺舒適。
同樣地，吵架、壓力、責罵會讓人心情低落、疲憊；
旅遊、聽音樂、看喜劇會讓人開心放鬆；
睡前看太多 3C 容易焦慮、難以入睡。

這些因素都可能讓人「生病」，但呈現方式不一定是細菌或病毒造成的身體疾病，有時則是心理層面的不適。當心理生病時，我們會找心理醫師，但若看診與用藥後仍沒有改善，那該怎麼辦？

這時，氣場解讀就能派上用場。

氣場解讀能協助處理那些 **你感覺得到，但並非細菌或病毒造成的心理與能量層面的問題**，例如：
憂鬱、空虛、寂寞、恐慌、焦慮、心情低落、迷惘、人生停滯、工作不順、親子議題、夫妻衝突、人際緊張、長輩壓力、愛情友情困境等。

氣場是你的「人體能量場」，其中蘊含你的一切：包含過去世的影響、當下的狀態，以及未來的可能性。
氣場解讀是一種身心靈的整體分析，協助你看清問題、找到方向。

最重要的是：
氣場解讀就像一份 **長期幫助你自我成長、自我療癒的計畫書**。
只要願意依循建議，相信自己的改變能力，許多困擾你多年的問題，其實都能逐步化解。

# Why do you need an aura reading?

I have done aura readings for many people. Some feel the readings are very accurate and helpful; some do not feel much, while others sense that they help to a certain degree.

Many people approach aura readings the same way they visit a doctor.
When they catch a cold, have the flu, or deal with chronic illnesses like diabetes, they expect that after seeing a doctor and taking medication, their symptoms will improve quickly.
So they also expect an aura reading to solve their problems within a short time—often within one or two weeks.

However, if you work in energy healing, you know how the aura—also called the human energy field—actually functions. You understand that healing work involves adjusting someone’s energy field, unblocking their chakras, and restoring energetic flow. Once the chakras operate smoothly, the person has the ability to self-heal, as long as they maintain a positive and open attitude.

Energy healing is **a long-term, self-healing process**. People who seek help from healers often have higher levels of self-awareness and are more open to new perspectives.


## Some people ask me: How can an aura reading help?

We all know that our living environment affects our well-being.
Living near a power plant or flight path harms the body;
living near a park with good ventilation and sunlight makes us feel better.
Likewise, arguments, pressure, and criticism can lower our mood and cause fatigue;
traveling, humor, gaming, and music can uplift us.
Using electronic devices before bed can cause anxiety and poor sleep.

These experiences can also make us “sick,” but the effects may not show as bacterial or viral illnesses—they often manifest emotionally or mentally. When our mind suffers, we may seek a psychologist. But if therapy and medication still do not bring improvement, what else can we do?

This is where an aura reading can help.

Aura readings address issues that **you can feel but are not caused by germs or physical illness**, such as:
depression, emptiness, loneliness, panic, anxiety, low mood, life confusion, stagnation, career obstacles, family conflict, relationship tension, pressure from elders, or struggles in love and friendships.

Your aura is your **energy field**, containing everything about you: past-life influences, your present condition, and potential future directions.
An aura reading is a holistic mind-body-spirit analysis that helps you see your challenges more clearly and discover answers.

Most importantly, an aura reading serves as a **long-term self-growth and self-healing roadmap**.
By following the insights and recommendations, and believing in your ability to change, many long-standing issues can gradually resolve.

## 何謂Aura氣場
- Aura,氣場,人體能量場,輝光,暉光,靈氣
- 範圍涵蓋人體周圍電磁粒子
## What Is Aura
- Aura, energy field, human energy field, radiance, luminescence, spiritual energy
- Covers electromagnetic particles surrounding the human body
## Aura氣場起源
- 西元前500-700年,印度的奧義書有提到五層能量場,但是沒有提到光
- 西元前320年,葛洪(號抱朴子),第一次以文獻方式紀錄人體周圍的光環及光
## Origin of Aura
- Around 500–700 BC, the Indian Upanishads mentioned five layers of the energy field, but did not mention light
- Around 320 BC, Ge Hong (styled Baopuzi) was the first to document the halo and light around the human body in written form
## Aura氣場七層
- 第一層: 生理層(Physical),與身體健康有關,常見的克里安照相技術,kirlian,GDV都是在屬於這一層
- 第二層: 乙太層(Etheirc),共有雙層,第二層代表永恆的自己,這裡保存輪迴,記憶,潛意識,並在人體死亡時把靈魂載走. 而一般所謂的鬼魂,也就是看到這一層.
- 第三層: 活力/生命能量(Vital),不只吸收能量,也是唯一還會對外發射能量.
- 第四層: 星光體(Astral),橢圓型,也稱為光環蛋,與周遭能量互動
- 第五層: 心智內層(Lower mental),智力水平
- 第六層: 心智外層(Higher mental),連結宇宙智慧
- 第七層: 靈性(Spirtual),吸收宇宙能量供生命使用
## Seven Layers of the Aura
- First Layer: Physical — related to physical health; commonly seen techniques such as Kirlian photography, Kirlian, and GDV belong to this layer
- Second Layer: Etheric — consists of two sublayers; this layer represents the eternal self, storing reincarnation, memories, and the subconscious, and carries the soul at physical death. What people commonly refer to as ghosts is essentially this layer.
- Third Layer: Vital — absorbs energy and is the only layer that also emits energy outward.
- Fourth Layer: Astral — oval-shaped, also known as the “auric egg,” interacts with surrounding energies.
- Fifth Layer: Lower Mental — associated with intellectual level.
- Sixth Layer: Higher Mental — connects to universal wisdom.
- Seventh Layer: Spiritual — absorbs cosmic energy for sustaining life.

### Have you ever asked yourself these questions, yet still couldn’t find the answers?

You’ve actually been trying very hard.
But some things can’t be untangled through endurance, effort, or logic alone.

You may be experiencing one of the following:

**▍Feeling powerless in a relationship**
You and your partner argue over small things, and both of you feel misunderstood.
You know the problem isn’t just about money, personality, or daily stress,
yet you can’t quite pinpoint where things are truly stuck.
You think about leaving, but you can’t bear to.
You stay, but it feels painful.
You carry everything on your own, unsure who you can turn to.

**▍Growing distance between you and your child**
Your child lacks motivation to study, and you feel worried, heartbroken, and helpless.
You miss the child who once clung to you,
but somewhere along the way, it feels like a wall has formed between you.
You want to help, but you don’t know what the real issue is.

**▍Loneliness within a relationship**
You have a partner, yet it feels like you’re holding everything together alone.
One of you earns money outside, the other carries the emotional and caregiving load at home.
There are no major conflicts, yet there is no real closeness either.

**▍Your child’s social struggles**
Your child says they have no friends at school, feel excluded, or misunderstood.
You want to help, but don’t know where to begin.
Teachers say everything is fine, but you know your child is hurting.

**▍Confusion about your career**
You feel unmotivated at work, yet you don’t know what would suit you better.
Changing jobs feels risky, but staying feels like your spirit is slowly fading.

**▍Uncertainty in a new relationship**
You sense something feels “off,”
but you can’t quite name what it is or decide whether to continue.

**▍Wanting to understand your true self**
You want to know your strengths and blind spots—
why the way others see you differs from how you see yourself.

**▍Feeling low or anxious without knowing why**
You know something isn’t right,
but no one seems able to explain what’s really going on.

**▍Wanting to know which colors truly support you**
Not just what looks good,
but which colors stabilize you, protect you, and support your emotional state.

**▍Wanting to understand your spiritual state**
You feel that life is more than just getting by,
yet you don’t know which stage your energy is currently in.

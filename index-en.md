### Have you ever asked yourself these questions, yet still couldn’t find the answers?

You’ve actually been trying very hard.
But some things can’t be untangled through endurance, effort, or logic alone.

You may be experiencing one of the following:

**▍Feeling powerless in a relationship**
You and your partner argue over small things, and both of you feel misunderstood.
You know the problem isn’t just about money, personality, or daily stress,
yet you can’t quite pinpoint where things are truly stuck.
You think about leaving, but you can’t bear to.
You stay, but it feels painful.
You carry everything on your own, unsure who you can turn to.

**▍Growing distance between you and your child**
Your child lacks motivation to study, and you feel worried, heartbroken, and helpless.
You miss the child who once clung to you,
but somewhere along the way, it feels like a wall has formed between you.
You want to help, but you don’t know what the real issue is.

**▍Loneliness within a relationship**
You have a partner, yet it feels like you’re holding everything together alone.
One of you earns money outside, the other carries the emotional and caregiving load at home.
There are no major conflicts, yet there is no real closeness either.

**▍Your child’s social struggles**
Your child says they have no friends at school, feel excluded, or misunderstood.
You want to help, but don’t know where to begin.
Teachers say everything is fine, but you know your child is hurting.

**▍Confusion about your career**
You feel unmotivated at work, yet you don’t know what would suit you better.
Changing jobs feels risky, but staying feels like your spirit is slowly fading.

**▍Uncertainty in a new relationship**
You sense something feels “off,”
but you can’t quite name what it is or decide whether to continue.

**▍Wanting to understand your true self**
You want to know your strengths and blind spots—
why the way others see you differs from how you see yourself.

**▍Feeling low or anxious without knowing why**
You know something isn’t right,
but no one seems able to explain what’s really going on.

**▍Wanting to know which colors truly support you**
Not just what looks good,
but which colors stabilize you, protect you, and support your emotional state.

**▍Wanting to understand your spiritual state**
You feel that life is more than just getting by,
yet you don’t know which stage your energy is currently in.

### Client Feedback

![](./aura-pic2.png)

### Client 1 Feedback

>I was able to gain a clearer awareness of my current state, and the personality description felt very accurate. The negative experiences from the womb period also resonated with me, and the guidance on aligning mind and body was truly valuable and insightful.

---

### Client 2 Feedback

>This analysis felt like looking into a mirror—it allowed me to see myself more clearly and better understand why I feel such a strong connection to nature. It not only helped me reflect on the past but also gently outlined new directions and possibilities for the future.

---

### Client 3 Feedback

>Through this reading, I gained a deeper understanding and awareness of my current state. The multi-layered insights and suggestions provided were truly helpful in supporting my self-awareness and personal adjustment. Overall, the experience was very meaningful and beneficial.

---

### Client 4 Feedback (Healing Practitioner)

>From a healer’s perspective, the comparison between the before-and-after aura readings was very accurate, especially in revealing deeper inner states that the client themselves may not yet be consciously aware of.
For example, during the healing process, I sensed unresolved issues in the sacral chakra related to non-recent relationships—areas the client had not yet consciously recognized.
When both parties are healers, it is often easier to understand each other’s language and insights. However, for those who are new to spiritual or energetic work, or who have limited self-awareness in this area, it may be more difficult to grasp the differences or fully understand what is being conveyed.
Therefore, I would suggest incorporating visual aids, such as images or simple diagrams, to help clients who are less familiar with energy work better understand the interpretations.

### Healer 5 Feedback (Healing Practitioner using the Aura Report with Clients)

>When I first received the report, I did not know the client personally, so I wasn’t entirely sure how to apply it. I could only identify which chakras might need more healing support, and I had no particular expectations about what would unfold during the session, as my intuitive perception tends to be quite fluid.
However, I found that one of the greatest strengths of this report is that it allows healers to anticipate areas where a client may need support. This was extremely helpful.
During the actual healing process, I noticed many experiences that closely aligned with what was described in the report.
For example, while working with the upper chakras, I sensed an unexplained fear and discomfort, which later became clear as being related to the client’s heightened sensitivity. When working on the front seven chakras, I also sensed a defensive quality—almost as if the energy was protecting the client—yet at the same time, I could feel the energy beginning to flow into the chakras. This strongly resonated with the report’s description of defensiveness and social anxiety.
In the follow-up conversation, I felt a much deeper sense of connection with the client. Overall, I believe this report is a very valuable tool for healers.

### Healer 6 Feedback

(Healing practitioner who conducted Aura readings for their family and applied the reports in other sessions)

>I conducted aura readings for my family members, and the results aligned remarkably well with our family dynamics. The emotions and experiences reflected in each person’s aura closely matched our real-life interactions, showing a strong sense of synchronicity.
I believe that people today place increasing importance on relationships, and this type of analysis is therefore highly valuable. With more accumulated cases, it could help establish a more systematic and structured evaluation process.
From a practical perspective, aura analysis can also help clarify healing priorities.
For example, when a client reports headaches, the intuitive approach might focus directly on the head. However, the aura information revealed that the root cause was related to trauma and emotional factors. During the actual healing session, it became clear that the lower chakras required significant energetic support. This suggested that blockages in the lower chakras were restricting upward energy flow, ultimately manifesting as head discomfort.

---

### Client 7 Feedback

>Thank you for providing these insights. I feel they are very accurate and have helped me clearly recognize the abilities I currently lack. The challenges I am facing now truly align with what you described. I will continue to adjust my physical and emotional state to become more grounded and resilient. I genuinely feel that your interpretation was very accurate.

---

### Client 8 Feedback

>I’m the one who asked you to do a reading for me a few days ago — it was incredibly accurate! I really think you’re amazing.

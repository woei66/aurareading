# Why do you need an aura reading?
An aura reading reveals your physical, emotional, and spiritual state in full clarity. It brings to light issues you are aware of or unaware of, problems you want to face or avoid, and obstacles you want to resolve but don’t know how.
Through the reading, you receive a clear “self-awareness list” that guides you on how to understand and face yourself.

Your aura is your **energy field**, containing everything about you:
your past-life influences, your present state, and your future potential.

Aura reading is a deep mind-body-spirit analysis that helps you see the true roots of your problems and find the answers you have been searching for.
